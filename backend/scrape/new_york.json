If, at any<br>meeting, action is proposed to be taken which would, if taken, entitle<br>shareholders fulfilling the requirements of section 623 (Procedure to<br>enforce shareholder's right to receive payment for shares) to receive<br>payment for their shares, the notice of such meeting shall include a<br>statement of that purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by<br>a copy of section 623 or an outline of its material terms. Notice of any<br>meeting shall be given not fewer than ten nor more than sixty days<br>before the date of the meeting, provided, however, that such notice may<br>be given by third class mail not fewer than twenty-four nor more than<br>sixty days before the date of the meeting, to each shareholder entitled<br>to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice is given when deposited<br>in the United States mail, with postage thereon prepaid, directed to the<br>shareholder at the shareholder's address as it appears on the record of<br>shareholders, or, if the shareholder shall have filed with the secretary<br>of the corporation a request that notices to the shareholder be mailed<br>to some other address, then directed to him at such other address. If<br>transmitted electronically, such notice is given when directed to the<br>shareholder's electronic mail address as supplied by the shareholder to<br>the secretary of the corporation or as otherwise directed pursuant to<br>the shareholder's authorization or instructions. An affidavit of the<br>secretary or other person giving the notice or of a transfer agent of<br>the corporation that the notice required by this section has been given<br>shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts<br>therein stated.<br><br>(b) When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, it shall not<br>be necessary, unless the by-laws require otherwise, to give any notice<br>of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is<br>adjourned and the means of electronic communications, if any, by which<br>shareholders and proxyholders may participate in the proceedings of the<br>meeting and/or vote or grant proxies at the meeting are announced at the<br>meeting at which the adjournment is taken, and at the adjourned meeting<br>any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the<br>original date of the meeting. However, if after the adjournment the<br>board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the<br>adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record on the<br>new record date entitled to notice under paragraph (a).<br><br>(c) Nothing required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall<br>limit, restrict or supersede other forms of voting and participation.<br>",

If the corporate<br>action has been consummated, such offer shall also be accompanied by (1)<br>advance payment to each such shareholder who has submitted the<br>certificates representing his shares to the corporation, as provided in<br>paragraph (f), of an amount equal to eighty percent of the amount of<br>such offer, or (2) as to each shareholder who has not yet submitted his<br>certificates a statement that advance payment to him of an amount equal<br>to eighty percent of the amount of such offer will be made by the<br>corporation promptly upon submission of his certificates. If the<br>corporate action has not been consummated at the time of the making of<br>the offer, such advance payment or statement as to advance payment shall<br>be sent to each shareholder entitled thereto forthwith upon consummation<br>of the corporate action. Every advance payment or statement as to<br>advance payment shall include advice to the shareholder to the effect<br>that acceptance of such payment does not constitute a waiver of any<br>dissenters' rights. If the corporate action has not been consummated<br>upon the expiration of the ninety day period after the shareholders'<br>authorization date, the offer may be conditioned upon the consummation<br>of such action. Such offer shall be made at the same price per share to<br>all dissenting shareholders of the same class, or if divided into<br>series, of the same series and shall be accompanied by a balance sheet<br>of the corporation whose shares the dissenting shareholder holds as of<br>the latest available date, which shall not be earlier than twelve months<br>before the making of such offer, and a profit and loss statement or<br>statements for not less than a twelve month period ended on the date of<br>such balance sheet or, if the corporation was not in existence<br>throughout such twelve month period, for the portion thereof during<br>which it was in existence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the<br>corporation shall not be required to furnish a balance sheet or profit<br>and loss statement or statements to any shareholder to whom such balance<br>sheet or profit and loss statement or statements were previously<br>furnished, nor if in connection with obtaining the shareholders'<br>authorization for or consent to the proposed corporate action the<br>shareholders were furnished with a proxy or information statement, which<br>included financial statements, pursuant to Regulation 14A or Regulation<br>14C of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. If within<br>thirty days after the making of such offer, the corporation making the<br>offer and any shareholder agree upon the price to be paid for his<br>shares, payment therefor shall be made within sixty days after the<br>making of such offer or the consummation of the proposed corporate<br>action, whichever is later, upon the surrender of the certificates for<br>any such shares represented by certificates.<br><br>(h) The following procedure shall apply if the corporation fails to<br>make such offer within such period of fifteen days, or if it makes the<br>offer and any dissenting shareholder or shareholders fail to agree with<br>it within the period of thirty days thereafter upon the price to be paid<br>for their shares:<br><br>(1) The corporation shall, within twenty days after the expiration of<br>whichever is applicable of the two periods last mentioned, institute a<br>special proceeding in the supreme court in the judicial district in<br>which the office of the corporation is located to determine the rights<br>of dissenting shareholders and to fix the fair value of their shares.<br>If, in the case of merger or consolidation, the surviving or new<br>corporation is a foreign corporation without an office in this state,<br>such proceeding shall be brought in the county where the office of the<br>domestic corporation, whose shares are to be valued, was located.<br><br>(2) If the corporation fails to institute such proceeding within such<br>period of twenty days, any dissenting shareholder may institute such<br>proceeding for the same purpose not later than thirty days after the<br>expiration of such twenty day period. If such proceeding is not<br>instituted within such thirty day period, all dissenter's rights shall<br>be lost unless the supreme court, for good cause shown, shall otherwise<br>direct.<br><br>(3) All dissenting shareholders, excepting those who, as provided in<br>paragraph (g), have agreed with the corporation upon the price to be<br>paid for their shares, shall be made parties to such proceeding, which<br>shall have the effect of an action quasi in rem against their shares.<br>The corporation shall serve a copy of the petition in such proceeding<br>upon each dissenting shareholder who is a resident of this state in the<br>manner provided by law for the service of a summons, and upon each<br>nonresident dissenting shareholder either by registered mail and<br>publication, or in such other manner as is permitted by law. The<br>jurisdiction of the court shall be plenary and exclusive.<br><br>(4) The court shall determine whether each dissenting shareholder, as<br>to whom the corporation requests the court to make such determination,<br>is entitled to receive payment for his shares. If the corporation does<br>not request any such determination or if the court finds that any<br>dissenting shareholder is so entitled, it shall proceed to fix the value<br>of the shares, which, for the purposes of this section, shall be the<br>fair value as of the close of business on the day prior to the<br>shareholders' authorization date. In fixing the fair value of the<br>shares, the court shall consider the nature of the transaction giving<br>rise to the shareholder's right to receive payment for shares and its<br>effects on the corporation and its shareholders, the concepts and<br>methods then customary in the relevant securities and financial markets<br>for determining fair value of shares of a corporation engaging in a<br>similar transaction under comparable circumstances and all other<br>relevant factors. The court shall determine the fair value of the shares<br>without a jury and without referral to an appraiser or referee.  Upon<br>application by the corporation or by any shareholder who is a party to<br>the proceeding, the court may, in its discretion, permit pretrial<br>disclosure, including, but not limited to, disclosure of any expert's<br>reports relating to the fair value of the shares whether or not intended<br>for use at the trial in the proceeding and notwithstanding subdivision<br>(d) of section 3101 of the civil practice law and rules.<br><br>(5) The final order in the proceeding shall be entered against the<br>corporation in favor of each dissenting shareholder who is a party to<br>the proceeding and is entitled thereto for the value of his shares so<br>determined.<br><br>(6) The final order shall include an allowance for interest at such<br>rate as the court finds to be equitable, from the date the corporate<br>action was consummated to the date of payment. In determining the rate<br>of interest, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including<br>the rate of interest which the corporation would have had to pay to<br>borrow money during the pendency of the proceeding. If the court finds<br>that the refusal of any shareholder to accept the corporate offer of<br>payment for his shares was arbitrary, vexatious or otherwise not in good<br>faith, no interest shall be allowed to him.<br><br>(7) Each party to such proceeding shall bear its own costs and<br>expenses, including the fees and expenses of its counsel and of any<br>experts employed by it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the court may, in<br>its discretion, apportion and assess all or any part of the costs,<br>expenses and fees incurred by the corporation against any or all of the<br>dissenting shareholders who are parties to the proceeding, including any<br>who have withdrawn their notices of election as provided in paragraph<br>(e), if the court finds that their refusal to accept the corporate offer<br>was arbitrary, vexatious or otherwise not in good faith. The court may,<br>in its discretion, apportion and assess all or any part of the costs,<br>expenses and fees incurred by any or all of the dissenting shareholders<br>who are parties to the proceeding against the corporation if the court<br>finds any of the following: (A) that the fair value of the shares as<br>determined materially exceeds the amount which the corporation offered<br>to pay; (B) that no offer or required advance payment was made by the<br>corporation; (C) that the corporation failed to institute the special<br>proceeding within the period specified therefor; or (D) that the action<br>of the corporation in complying with its obligations as provided in this<br>section was arbitrary, vexatious or otherwise not in good faith. In<br>making any determination as provided in clause (A), the court may<br>consider the dollar amount or the percentage, or both, by which the fair<br>value of the shares as determined exceeds the corporate offer.<br><br>(8) Within sixty days after final determination of the proceeding, the<br>corporation shall pay to each dissenting shareholder the amount found to<br>be due him, upon surrender of the certificates for any such shares<br>represented by certificates.<br><br>(i) Shares acquired by the corporation upon the payment of the agreed<br>value therefor or of the amount due under the final order, as provided<br>in this section, shall become treasury shares or be cancelled as<br>provided in section 515 (Reacquired shares), except that, in the case of<br>a merger or consolidation, they may be held and disposed of as the plan<br>of merger or consolidation may otherwise provide.<br><br>(j) No payment shall be made to a dissenting shareholder under this<br>section at a time when the corporation is insolvent or when such payment<br>would make it insolvent. In such event, the dissenting shareholder<br>shall, at his option:<br><br>(1) Withdraw his notice of election, which shall in such event be<br>deemed withdrawn with the written consent of the corporation; or<br><br>(2) Retain his status as a claimant against the corporation and, if it<br>is liquidated, be subordinated to the rights of creditors of the<br>corporation, but have rights superior to the non-dissenting<br>shareholders, and if it is not liquidated, retain his right to be paid<br>for his shares, which right the corporation shall be obliged to satisfy<br>when the restrictions of this paragraph do not apply.<br><br>(3) The dissenting shareholder shall exercise such option under<br>subparagraph (1) or (2) by written notice filed with the corporation<br>within thirty days after the corporation has given him written notice<br>that payment for his shares cannot be made because of the restrictions<br>of this paragraph. If the dissenting shareholder fails to exercise such<br>option as provided, the corporation shall exercise the option by written<br>notice given to him within twenty days after the expiration of such<br>period of thirty days.<br><br>(k) The enforcement by a shareholder of his right to receive payment<br>for his shares in the manner provided herein shall exclude the<br>enforcement by such shareholder of any other right to which he might<br>otherwise be entitled by virtue of share ownership, except as provided<br>in paragraph (e), and except that this section shall not exclude the<br>right of such shareholder to bring or maintain an appropriate action to<br>obtain relief on the ground that such corporate action will be or is<br>unlawful or fraudulent as to him.<br><br>(l) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, any notice<br>to be given by a corporation to a shareholder under this section shall<br>be given in the manner provided in section 605 (Notice of meetings of<br>shareholders).<br><br>(m) This section shall not apply to foreign corporations except as<br>provided in subparagraph (e) (2) of section 907 (Merger or consolidation<br>of domestic and foreign corporations).<br>",
